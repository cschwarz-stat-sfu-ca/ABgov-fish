# Creating a draft Watershed Assessment Report
## Introduction

A draft watershed assessment report will be created in MSWord using data extracted from the FWIS database.
This draft report can then be edited by tweaking the R code (preferred) or tweaking the MSWord document (not preferred because your
changes will be lost when you update the report by rerunning the _R_ code).

The draft report is created using _R_ and _JAGS_  (a program that does Bayesian computatons)
to compute summary statistics, compute the probability of belonging to the FSI categories, 
and make plots (using _ggplot2_). 
_RMarkdown_ is used to mingle text and graphics and is rendered into a MSWord document.

This process follows the principle of Reproducible Research, 
where a single document contains ALL of the code used to analyze the data and
creates a report based on this. It is hoped that when each Watershed Assessment is updated, it will be necessary only to rerun the
code and do some minor teaks to the report.

## Getting your computer ready
Your computer will need the following software. Instructions for installing the software can be found
at <http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~cschwarz/CourseNotes/HowGetSoftware.html>.

* _R_. This is the statistical software used create summary table and to create plots. 
Don't forget to install the packages (add ons for _R_) as listed
in item (6) of the installation instructions in the above link. You will also need to install the following packages:
    + _stringr_ specialized functions for text processing
    + _R2Jags_, _coda_, _digest_ needed to run JAGS
    +  _pander_  needed to create tables in _RMarkdown_ 
    + _ggmaps_ needed to extract Google maps over the web. You should install this from CRAN so that
      all package dependencies are also load. Then you also need  the most recent version which has NOT yet been released 
      to CRAN. You need to install it using   
        - `devtools::install_github('dkahle/ggmap')`   
     on the R console. This may require the _devtools_ package to also be installed. So, install the OLD version
     of _ggmaps_ from CRAN (to get the dependent packages) and then install the most recent version from GitHub to overwrite
     the older version. 

* _RStudio_. An integrated development environment that controls _R_ and its output.

* _JAGS_ (Just Another Gibbs Sampler). A cross-platform program that performs Bayesian computations. This program will be called by _R_.
Don't forget to install the additional _R_ packages listed under item (2) of the _JAGS_ installation instructions in the above link namely:
    + _R2Jags_, _coda_, and _digest_ needed to run JAGS


## Getting the FWIS data
Information on each watershed is extracted from the FWIS database. Contact ????? for further details.

**The current extraction program creates Excel 95 files. 
_R_ requires workbooks to be in Excel 97 or later format, so you will have to open and save
the file as Excel 97 or later format.**

Many people simply find it easier to to save the FWIS file as a _csv_ file and use that directly.


## Create a working directory to hold the data files and the draft template.
Create a working directory which will include the _RMarkdown_ files used to create the draft
watershed report and any data files, image files, etc. needed for the report.

### Copy the _RMarkdown_ template files to the working directory.
The template files are located on the  _GitHub_ server and can be retreived as follows.

* Go to <https://github.com/cschwarz-stat-sfu-ca/ABgov-fish>
The web page will look similar to:
```{r, out.height="4in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","GitHubMainPage.png"))
```


* Click on the _Clone or Download_ button to download a zip file of the entire contents.

* Move the zip file to your working directory.

* Unzip the zip file.

* Discard the zip file.

* Your working directory should now have several subdirectories:
```{r, out.height="1in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","MainDirectoryStructure.png"))
```


* Open the _WatershedReport_ directory 
```{r, out.height="2in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","WatershedDirectory.png"))
```


### Move the FWIS data file to the _Data_ directory.
Move the FWIS data file to the _Data_ directory. **The data file MUST be in Excel 97 or later format.** 
The FWIS extraction system currently creates an Excel 95 file. You will have to open it and re-save it as an Excel 97 or later
document (either _.xls_ or _.xlsx_ is fine).
```{r, out.height="2.5in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","DataDirectory.png"))
```

If you are unable to read the Excel workbook properly, open the FWIS data file and save the 'F&W' sheet as a _csv_file.
You will have to modify the main template file as noted later.


### Duplicate and rename the main template file and the species template files.
We plan to analyze the _Quirk Creek_ data and so we will rename the main template and species template
files by adding a prefix (e.g. QC-) to the _WatershedTemplate.Rmd_ and _SpeciesSubsection-BKTR.Rmd_ files.

**DO NOT MODIFY THE NAME OF THE WatershedTemplate-STYLE.docx** file as this is 
a style template for the _MSWord_ reports used by _RMarkdown_ when
creating the draft watershed report. 

You will now have two new files (copied and renamed) of the template files:
```{r, out.height="1in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","DuplicatedFiles.png"))
```


### Clone the species template files.
The GitHub site comes with a single species subsection template and you will have to clone this
for the other species of interest in the watershed report. A clone is identical to the template for BKTR
except all occurances of BKTR are replaced by the species code of interest (e.g. CTTR). This cloning
can be done by making duplicates of the BKTR template and changing the name of the file and, then within the file,
all occurances of BKTR to the new species code.

I have provided a file, _clone-species.templates.R_, that can do this for you. **Be careful not to overwrite 
any species template files that you have modified as part of the assessment.**

For example, suppose we want species template files for BKTR (already present), BLBK, BLTR and CTTR.

* Open the _clone-species.templates.R_ file using _RStudio_ (and NOT R). 
* **BE SURE YOU ARE POINTED TO THE CORRECT WORKING DIRECTORY** by examining the name on the console window of _RStudio_. 
(Your directory name will differ from mine shown below.)
```{r, out.height="1in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","CheckWd.png"))
```


* The Rstudio script pane will have the _R_ code from the _clone-species.templates.R_ file and will look similar to :
```{r clone, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Clone the BKTR species files for other species
library(plyr)
species.list <- c("ARGR","BLBK",'BLTR',"BURB",'CTTR',"LKCH","RNTR")

l_ply(species.list, function (x){
   # read the BKTR SpeciesSubsection, change all BKTR to the species list, and write out new file
   filename <- 'SpeciesSubsection-BKTR.Rmd'
   template <- readLines(filename)
   template <- gsub("BKTR", x, template, fixed=TRUE)
   filename <- gsub("BKTR", x, filename, fixed=TRUE) 
   writeLines(template, filename, sep='\r\n' )
})
```

* Modify the list of species codes.
* Change the name of the template file _SpeciesSubsection-BKTR.Rmd_ to _QC-SpeciesSubsection-BKTR.Rmd_
* Run the code. Your directory should now be populated with copies of the species template files for this watershed.

```{r, out.height="2in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","ClonedSpeciesTemplates.png"))
```

### Check the FSI category boundaries for the species of interest.
The FSI category boundaries are stored in the _FSI.threshold.R_ file. This can be edited directly
in _RStudio_ or any other text editor.




## Editing the main template file.
### Overview of process
Each watershed report will have one main template file (_QC-WatershedTemplate.Rd_ in our case) and one or more
species template files (_QC-SpeciesSubsection-BKTR.Rmd_ etc.) that are _knitted_ (in _R_ parlance) together. These
template files contain both text and _R_ code as a living document so that as the data change, the report is updated when the
the template are again knitted together.

The templates are written using _RMarkdown_ <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> which provides a simple set of commands
to knit together _R_ code and (formatted) text as shown below:

```{r, out.height="1in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","Knitting.png"))
```


When you wish to render the document, _R Markdown_ feeds the _.Rmd_ file to _knitr_, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (_.md_) document which includes the code and itâ€™s output in a general way.The _pandoc_ program (included with _RStudio_) converts the
markdown document to the final format (HTML, PDF, MSWord, etc.). 
While the above seems complicated, most of it is hidden from you and 
occurs "behind the scenes."

Creating the draft watershed reports will follow a multi-step process.

1. Read in the data from the FWIS system (the workbook you copied to the _Data_ directory) and create some preliminary tables
and plots to check the data, remove and outliers, or do any other pre-processing. This preprocessing is 'hidden' from the
draft watershed assessment report, but the code used to pre-process the data is stored with the document. Consequently,
when you update the assessment in a later year, the decisions made in pre-processing the data are evident.

2. Make some summary tables and plots for the wateshed as a whole. The current template makes some simple tables of counts of
fish species by year etc and produces a map showing the sampling locations. You are able to change the default figures and tables by modifying the
corresponding _R_ code.

3. For each species of interest, the corresponding species template file creates some summary charts and figures. It then calls
_JAGS_ to estimate the probability that the species is in each FSI category accounting for process and sampling error over time.
Summary figures are presented which again can be changed by modifying the _R_ code. I would suggest that you analyze one species at a time
until all are working to your satisfaction.

4. Finally, you can enter summary text describing the state of this watershed.


Open the main template file (_QC-WatershedTemplate.Rmd_ for this example) in _RStudio_. The script pane will look similar to:
```{r, out.height="4in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","MainTemplate-init-open.png"))
```


The template file consists of 3 types of material:

* The headers (between the ---'s) which identifies the watershed assessment name, author, date
of creating, and list the options to be applied when the document is rendered. In this case, 
change the name of the title to a more appropriate name along with the author. The date
uses _R_ to extract the date the code is run and formats it as YYYY-MM-DD. The options for a
 MSWord rendering indicate that the _WatershedTemplate-STYLE.docx_ file is to be used
 for styles when creating the document (this style document is where you specify that the sections are to be numbered).
 The headers only occur once in a template at the top of the primary file.
 
* Code chunks. These are sections of _R_ code of the form delimited by triple BACK quotes 
with _R_ code in between.
````python
`r ''````{r chunkname, options}
   R code here
```
````
Each chunk has a number of options specifying if the
output is to be displayed in the report (e.g. a plot), or computations are proceed with nothing placed in the report.
A list of chunk options is available at: <https://yihui.name/knitr/options/>. There is no limit to the number or types
of chunks you can use.

* Text (scroll down the script window to see):

```{r, out.height="2in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","MainTemplate-text.png"))
```

which is written using _R Markdown_ (refer to <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf>).
There is no limit to the amount of text you can use.

The text and code chunks can be intermixed at will.

### Loading libraries.
Return to the main template file (_QC-WatershedTemplate.Rmd_ for this example) in _RStudio_.

The first chunk (labelled _setup_) is where we set up the _R_ code by opening the libraries needed for the analyses,
read in the data file, and do any data editing. The option _include=FALSE_ implies that any of the output from this
chunk will NOT be included in the draft report.

You can execute all of the _R_ code in an entire chunk by clicking on the _Run_ pop-down menu 
of _RStudio_ and selecting the appropriate option.

```{r, out.height="1in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","RunChunk.png"))
```


Or you can run one or several lines at a time by selecting, hightlighting, and then using the _Run_ pop-down menu:

```{r, out.height="2in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","RunSelectLines.png"))
```

The keyboard short cuts (Command-Enter for Macintosh; Cntr-R for Windoze) can also be used.

You will find it useful to send all output to the console window during the template setup using:

```{r, out.height="2in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","ChunkOutputConsole.png"))
```


#### Select which species you want to report on.
About 20 lines down the first chunk, you will see the code fragment:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
target.species <- 'ALL'  
#target.species <- c("BKTR","BLTR","MNWH") # or you can select which species to include
```

If you have particular species in mind, you can select them here by specifying the species codes (in any order)
or using _`ALL'_ to select all species from the FWIS worksheet. Even if you specify that all species are to 
be read in from the FWIS workbook, you have the option of selecting which species will have the FSI categorization done
later in the code.

In this case, we will leave the defaults as is. Notice the _R_ comment indicator (#) in the second line of the code
fragment implies that this line is ignored.

#### Specifying the file name of the FWIS workbook.
The next code fragment is where the workbook name of the FWIS workbook is specified along with the sheetname containing the data.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
workbookName = file.path('Data','Quirk Creek.xls')  
sheetName    = 'F&W'
```

Here the workbook is located in the _Data_ subdirectory in the current working directory. The sheetname is "F&W".

If you trouble reading the Excel workbook, you will need to save the 'F&W' sheet as a _csv_ file using Excel. Then specify the file 
name as:
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
csvfilename = file.path('Data','Quirk Creek.csv')  # notice the csv suffix on the final file name 
```




#### Read in the data directly from Excel
Choose either this  code fragment if reading Excel workbooks is working or the next code fragement
if it is not.
This code fragment checks that the workbook exists and then calls a function to read the FWIS workbook.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
if(!file.exists(workbookName))stop(paste("File ",workbookName,' not found ')) 

# read the sheet from the workbook   
fish <- read.FWIS.workbook( 
        workbookName  =workbookName,   
        sheetName     =sheetName,   
        target.species=target.species)   
```

#### Read in the data (from a _csv_ file)
If you have saved the data as a _csv_ file, use these code fragments.
This fragment checks that the _csv_ file exists and then calls a function to read the FWIS workbook.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
if(!file.exists(csvfilename))stop(paste("File ",csvfilename,' not found ')) 

# read the sheet from the workbook   
fish <- read.FWIS.workbook.csv(    # notice the suffix on the function call
        csvfilename,   
        sheetName     =sheetName,   
        target.species=target.species)   
```




Highlight and run all of the code block from the start to the end of the fragment above.

fish <- read.FWIS.workbook.csv(
        csvfilename,
        target.species=target.species)

```

#### Check and edit the data
The fish length data is used to create three data frames used in subsequent analyses.

1. _Inventory_ data frame which consists of one record per _Inventory.Survey.ID_ with information on the location
of the inventory, the distance sampled, the time sampled, etc. 

2. _Catch.Summary_ data frame which consists of one record per Location per year with the catch per 300 m computed.
Value of 0 are imputed for species counts in inventories where a species was not captured.

3. _Fish_ data frame with information on individual fish measurements. 

The next sections of code creates summary tables to check the data (e.g. invalid species code, missing species code);
create cross-tabulations by years collected, the type of equipment used (e.g., backpack electrofishing) etc. Here is where you 
can exclude data, for example, from angling surveys that are not amenable to the CPUE computations. 

**It is important that you review the output of these sections carefully before creating the summary report to
ensure that all data has been captured without error**. Some common errors are:

* Location data (UTM/TTM Easting/Northing) not consistent across years. The combination of the UTM.TTM Easting/Northing
is used to define a location so if these differ by 1 m, it will be assumed that a new location was sampled. 

* Distance or timing data missing. These are needed to compute the CPUE. You may have to impute some values from previous years
that were not recorded. Ideally, the FWIS data base should be updated.

* Species codes missing

* Missing years of data

Ideally, the
original FWIS database should be updated to correct these errors, but they can corrects on the fly in this code. 

You can work your way through the code in the chunk, line by line, to examine the output as needed.
Some of the output from the data screening is shown below:

```{r  echo=TRUE}
# what years are present in this workbooks?
xtabs(~Year, data=fish, exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)

# what species are present in this workbook
xtabs(~Species.Code, data=fish, exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)

```

```{r  echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# After reading in the data, you should check  basic statistics such as the years
# measurements are taken, the Location names are spelled consistently, etc
xtabs(~Activity.Date+Inventory.Survey.ID, data=fish, exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)
unique(fish[,c("Activity.Date","Inventory.Survey.ID")])


xtabs(~LocationTTM+Year,      data=fish , exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)
# are there any dates that are invalid
fish[ is.na(fish$Year),]

xtabs(~Species.Code + Year,  data=fish , exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)
fish[ is.na(fish$Species.Code) | fish$Species.Code=="",]
# remove records with blank species codes
dim(fish)
fish <- fish[ !(is.na(fish$Species.Code) | fish$Species.Code==""),]
dim(fish)
xtabs(~Species.Code + Year,  data=fish , exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)
```

Here we remove all non-electrofishing survey types:
```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
xtabs(~Survey.Type + Year,     data=fish , exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)
# Remove all non-electrofishing survey types
dim(fish)
fish <- fish[ fish$Survey.Type %in% c("Electrofishing"),]
dim(fish)
xtabs(~Survey.Type + Year,     data=fish , exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)
```

Data editing proceeds untils you are satisfied that all of the data should be 
included in the subsequent analyses.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Check the equipment type field
xtabs(~Equipment.Type + Year,    data=fish , exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)
xtabs(~Equipment.Type + Survey.Type, data=fish, exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)


# Check the fork length field
plyr::ddply(fish, c("Species.Code"), plyr::summarize, 
            nfish=length(Fork.Length..mm.),
            nmiss=sum(is.na(Fork.Length..mm.)),
            fl.min=min(Fork.Length..mm., na.rm=TRUE),
            fl.max=max(Fork.Length..mm., na.rm=TRUE))
# which records are missing Fork Length
fish[ is.na(fish$Fork.Length..mm.),]


# check the Distance and time fields
xtabs(~Distance..m., data=fish, exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)
xtabs(~LocationTTM+Distance..m., data=fish, exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)

# impute a distance field
fish$Distance..m.[ is.na(fish$Distance..m.)] <- 100
xtabs(~Distance..m., data=fish, exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)
xtabs(~LocationTTM+Distance..m., data=fish, exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)

xtabs(~Inventory.Survey.ID+Distance..m., data=fish, exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)

xtabs(~Time..s.,     data=fish, exclude=NULL, na.action=na.pass)# remove data where no distance or time


```

#### Modifying the introductory text.
After the first code chunk, some introductory text is given:

>\# Background  
>"How are the fish in my river and streams doing?"  
>We need this answer to set appropriate fishing regulations,   
>to understand and correct any problems with fish habitat and   
>to guard against invasive species.  
>
>A healthy fish population and fish community means we   
>can all enjoy the benefits of sustainable fisheries   
>and healthy ecosystems.   
>A standard method of assessing the status of   
>fish populations is necessary to allow comparisons of fish sustainability   

All text is written using _RMarkdown_ <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf>
and there is plenty of help available on the web (thanks Google!). Text can be entered free form, i.e. you can
break lines anywhere in a paragraph and it will be flowed together, EXCEPT if a line has two or more space characters at the 
end, in which case it is treated as line break.

A hash mark (\#} indicates a level 1 header; two hash marks (\#\#) indicate a level 2 header and so on.

Text is italiczed by enclosing with underscores, e.g.

>Westslope Cutthroat Trout (\_Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi\_),   
>Bull Trout (\_Salvelinus confluentus\_),   
>Arctic Grayling (\_Thymallus arcticus\_),   
>Athabasca Rainbow Trout (\_Oncorhynchus mykiss\_),   

In some cases, placeholders are present where you need to modify the text as information is not available from the
FWIS system. Here the number of potential sampling locations (not the actual number taken) must be entered manually
replacing the 99999999 placeholder. The \*\* indicate boldfaced text to make it standout in the draft report in case you forget to
change this.

>Within the study area, 
>\*\*999999999\*\*
>potential sampling locations were randomly 
>chosen using ArcGIS (ESRI, 2013) and R (R Core Team, 2015) 

You can also include _R_ code expressions inline in the text. See the _RMarkdown_ manuals for details.

#### Creating a map of sampling locations
The code chunk labelled _WatershedMap_, creates a map of the sampling locations. It uses the range of latitude and longitude (expanded
by a small amount)
to set a bounding box before calling Google Maps to return a satellite image. 
Unfortunately, Google Maps returns a map based on the center of the bounding box and a zoom factor -- the 
_get\_map_ function tries to compute the appropriate factors but doesn't aways succeed. For example,
the default zoom factor gives the following map:

```{r map.fignum, echo=FALSE}
   fig.map<-getFIGNUM()
```

```{r  echo=TRUE, include=TRUE,fig.height=3}
# Extract the min/max of lat/long and make slightly larger to try and capture entire map
lat  <- range(fish$Latitude,  na.rm=TRUE)
long <- range(fish$Longitude, na.rm=TRUE)
# Exapnd these slighly
lat  <- lat + c(-1,1)* (lat[2]-lat[1])/5
long <- long+ c(-1,1)* (long[2]-long[1])/5
 
# get the map 
boundaries<-c( long[1], lat[1], long[2], lat[2])
 
# get the map from google. You can fiddle with the zoom to get the right scale
#cc <- get_map(cc.boundaries, maptype="terrain",  source="google")#zoom=13)
google.map <- get_map(boundaries, maptype="satellite",  source="google") #, zoom=11)

my.map <- ggmap(google.map)

# Exract the sampling points
stations <- unique( fish[,c("TTM.Easting","TTM.Northing","Longitude","Latitude")])
plot1 <- my.map +
         ggtitle(paste('Figure ', fig.map,". Location of sampling sites on ", fish$WatershedName[1],sep=""))+
         theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8))+  # change text size for title
         geom_point(data=stations, aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude),size=2, color='red', 
                    position=position_jitter(h=.0015, w=.0015) )+
          xlab("Latitude")+ylab("Longitude")
plot1
```

Not all of the sampling locations are shown in the returned map. By trial and error,
 a zoom factor of 13 gives good results:

```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} 
google.map <- get_map(boundaries, maptype="satellite",  source="google", zoom=13)
```


```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, fig.height=3}
my.map <- ggmap(google.map)

# Extract the sampling points
stations <- unique( fish[,c("TTM.Easting","TTM.Northing","Longitude","Latitude")])
plot1 <- my.map +
         ggtitle(paste('Figure ', fig.map,". Location of sampling sites on ", fish$WatershedName[1],sep=""))+
         theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8))+  # change text size for title
         geom_point(data=stations, aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude),size=2, color='red', 
                    position=position_jitter(h=.0015, w=.0015) )+
          xlab("Latitude")+ylab("Longitude")
plot1
```

Notice how figure and table numbers are generated. You need to execute a code chunk prior to first usage which generates
a table or figure number and assigns it to a variable that can be used in the text or in code blocks.

#### Creating a table.
Unfortunately, tables are more difficult to get nicely formatted in _RMarkdown_ unless one is using a _LaTeX_ rendering engine,
in which case you have have very fine control. However, _LaTeX_ is likely too complicated for mere mortals.


```{r FishSummaryTabNum, echo=FALSE}
tab.fishsummary   <-getTABNUM();
```

The _pandoc.table_ function does a reasonable job. First the summary statistics are computed 
in the usual way:

```{r FishSummaryTable10, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Comput the summary statstics for each species by year
fish.stat <- plyr::ddply(fish, c("Species.Code"), plyr::summarize,
                   nfish = length(Fork.Length..mm.),
                   fl.mean=round(mean(Fork.Length..mm., na.rm=TRUE)),
                   fl.min= round(min(Fork.Length..mm. , na.rm=TRUE)),
                   fl.max= round(max(Fork.Length..mm. , na.rm=TRUE)))
fish.stat$fl.min[ is.infinite(fish.stat$fl.min)] <- NA
fish.stat$fl.max[ is.infinite(fish.stat$fl.max)] <- NA

# Sort by species
fish.stat <- fish.stat[ order(fish.stat$Species),]
head(fish.stat)
```

Then we create the column labels (the \\n in the label implies a line break)

```{r echo=TRUE}
colnames(fish.stat) <- c(
       "Species\nCode",
       "n",
       "Mean\nfork\nlength\nmm",
       "Min\nfork\nlength\nmm",
       "Max\nfork\nlength\nmm"
    )
```

and then the _pandoc.table_ creates the output to be rendered
```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
pandoc.table(fish.stat,
             caption=paste("Table ",tab.fishsummary,
                           ". Summary statistics on species of fish captured in ",
                           fish$WatershedName[1], sep=""),
             justify='lrrrr',
             split.cells=c(1,1,1,1,1))
```
Refer to the help file in _R_ for _pandoc.table_ for information on the options such as 
justification (justify='1rrrr' implies the first column is left justified, the second is right etc.),
and relative sizes of columns (split.cells=c(1,1,1,1,1) implies that all columns are approximately equal in width).

Notice that the output from _pandoc.table_ gets processed into a "nicer" looking table in MSWord, but there
is only limited control over formatting tables in basic _RMarkdown_.

#### Run the preliminary report WITHOUT any analysis at the species level.
You are now ready to try to create your first draft assessment, WITHOUT any detailed analyses at the species level.

Use the _Knit_ button in _RStudio_ to render the document in the format required.

```{r, out.height="2in",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Figures","KnitMain.png"))
```

If all goes well, a document in the format requested should be produced. Check the console for errors in either the
rendering process or the the _R_ code execution process for debugging. It is a bit of an art, but because all chunks are 
labelled, you can see in which chunk the _R_ code failed. 

I find it easier to create HTML documents during the debugging phase and leave creating the MSWord creation to the end.

CONGRATULATIONs! You have created your first draft of a watershed assessment!



## Requesting species analysis
Now that you have the main document working, let us work on the species analysis.
I would do a single species at a time before rendering the final document.

For species with limited data (e.g. only 3 captured fish), this is a waste of time. Similarly, for
species of limited interest, this is also a waste of time.

You need to specify the names of (updated) species template files in the code fragment below. You need to change
```{r setspecies-old, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Select which species you want assessment for. Comment out those you don't need. Don't forget the commas.
#  Don't forget to remove any commas after the final species selected
#child.list <- c(
#        'SpeciesSubsection-ARGR.Rmd',
#        'SpeciesSubsection-BKTR.Rmd',
#        'SpeciesSubsection-BLTR.Rmd',
#        'SpeciesSubsection-BLBK.Rmd',
#        'SpeciesSubsection-BURB.Rmd',
#        'SpeciesSubsection-CTTR.Rmd'
#        'SpeciesSubsection-RNTR.Rmd'
#       )
```
 to something like 

```{r setspecies, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Select which species you want assessment for. Comment out those you don't need. Don't forget the commas.
#  Don't forget to remove any commas after the final species selected
child.list <- c(
   'QC-SpeciesSubsection-BKTR.Rmd'
       )
```

to do one species analysis (in this case for BKTR).

After making this change to the main template document, render it again using the _knit_ button in _RStudio_.
Note on my Macintosh, the code always ends with an error message about a _segfault_, but the final document has
been rendered, so just ignore the error message about an `In irrecoverable exception occured, R is aborting now.'.
The rendered file is in the directory and can be opened in the usual way.

There is really nothing to modify in the species template file (the code is self contained) unless you want to modify some of the plots automatically created or add
explanatory text around some of the output. All of the plots are standard _ggplot_ objects and so can be edited in the
usual way.

The Bayesian analysis returns a list object (_fsi.result_) that you can use to create customized plots or extract 
information of interest such as the actual probabilities of belonging to each FSI category by year.

Congradulation - almost done. Continue to analyze one species at a time until you are happy with each of the
species analyses. Then put all of them together to create the combined report.


## Finish up the summary
Now that all of the species sections are working, update the default summary text and
render the final draft document in the format of your choice (MSWord, PDF, HTML, etc.)


## Words of wisdom.
Remember, any changes to the _Rmd_ documents will be retained the next time you render the document.
Any changes you make to the MSWord document will be lost the next time you render the document.
Consequently, try and make the _Rmd_ documents as self contained as possible.

Try and include any editing decisions such a removing outliers in the first code chunk of the main template
file. In this way, all editing decisions are recorded and will be done the next time the code is run. Remember,
you want the template files to be as self-contained and produce reproducible results.

If you get an error message and nothing is rendered, look carefully at the RMarkdown Tab in the console pane
of _RStudio_ to identify in which code block the error occured. If the error occurs in the Bayesian analysis, 
you will need to give me a call unless you are a glutton for punishment as debugging JAGS will make you hair turn 
grey quickly.

It is possible to adust the MSWord Style file -- give me a call to discuss what kind of changes you want
to the style file. It is not for the faint of heart. Here are some links on editing the style file - Google is your friend.
